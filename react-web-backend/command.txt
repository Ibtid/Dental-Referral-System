Debug Run: npm run start:dev
Run: npm run start

Generating new resource:
nest g resource

Create individual items:
Let's imagine a real-world scenario, where we need to expose CRUD endpoints for 2 entities, let's say User and Product entities. Following the best practices, for each entity we would have to perform several operations, as follows:

Generate a module (nest g mo) to keep code organized and establish clear boundaries (grouping related components)
Generate a controller (nest g co) to define CRUD routes (or queries/mutations for GraphQL applications)
Generate a service (nest g s) to implement & isolate business logic
Generate an entity class/interface to represent the resource data shape
Generate Data Transfer Objects (or inputs for GraphQL applications) to define how the data will be sent over the network

Create a controller:
nest g controller cats

code first approach (create table in postgres)
First Create a model with table name in schema.prisma file
Then run: npx prisma migrate dev --name filename
Ex: npx prisma migrate dev --name updatedUserModel
